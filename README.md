# Information for Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

# 30 volunteers (70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data)
# -> see subject_test / subject_train
# Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
# -> see activity_labels

# The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
#- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range # is from 1 to 30. 
# - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in
# standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the
# 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
# - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from
# the total acceleration. 
# - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window # sample. The units are radians/second. 



# 1st Step: load all data into R 
#    - use script "load_data.R"
#    - make sure to choose the correct working directory
